## Context

Activities need reusable Player participation intent that can express projected
Slots, readiness requirements and compatibility without duplicating Session rules
inside each scene.

## Decision

Activity Player participation is authored through the approved Activity/Route
policy surface and resolves into one normalized effective policy with provenance.

Runtime consumes explicit Slot/Player/Actor evidence and publishes requested and
effective state plus diagnostic reasons. Invalid or incompatible states fail
explicitly.

Activity participation does not own or silently mutate Player Session
configuration.

## Session boundary

```text
PlayerSessionProfile
  owns Supported Slots
  owns Initial Joining
  owns Session Host Provisioning
  owns Actor Resolution

Activity Player policy
  projects/qualifies current Session Slots
  defines participation/readiness intent
  does not replace Session provisioning
  does not create Capacity
```

## Constraints

- One normalized effective participation policy is runtime input.
- Provenance and requested/effective differences remain diagnosable.
- Invalid compatibility never falls back silently.
- Activity/GameFlow tests may consume a stable Player fixture but cannot become
  Player Session configuration authority.
- Participation policy does not become a Host provisioning mode.

## FIRSTGAME boundary

Real-product integration should prove participation against the same official
package contracts after the underlying Player provisioning mode is integrated.
Any UX friction observed during that proof is qualitative and does not change the
participation contract's functional completion arithmetic.
