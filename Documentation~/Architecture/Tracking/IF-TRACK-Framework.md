# IF-TRACK — Immersive Framework

Status: **Active — current implemented baseline + Stage B consumer evidence**  
Last updated: **2026-08-31**

## Authority and status model

```text
Accepted ADRs    -> normative architecture
Governance       -> cross-cutting compatibility/product policy
Reconciliation   -> current technical alignment/certification
Tracker          -> current mutable delivery state
FIRSTGAME        -> Stage B real-consumer evidence
Archive          -> historical/non-authoritative execution history
```

A dated certification remains evidence for the boundary it executed. Later cuts add evidence; they do not retroactively relabel historical matrices.

## Current Player state

The Player architecture is reconciled through IF-ADR-023 plus the post-certification occurrence-identity boundary in IF-ADR-023A.

```text
Local Player Host
└── ActorMount
    └── PlayerActorRuntimeHost
        ├── PlayerActorDeclaration
        └── PresentationMount
            └── ActorProfile.PresentationPrefab
```

Current transaction split:

```text
Join
!= Actor Selection
!= Activity Actor Preparation
!= Physical Materialization
```

Current Player Actor identity boundary:

```text
AUTHORED / UNPREPARED
  PlayerActorDeclaration.actorId = empty

→ physical preparation establishes runtime occurrence identity

IDENTITY ESTABLISHED / PREPARING
  typed PlayerActorDeclaration.ActorId is valid

→ commit

PREPARED / COMMITTED
  physical preparation evidence retained
```

`PlayerActorDeclaration.ActorId` is runtime occurrence identity. It is not a persistent prefab/template identity. Ordinary persistent `ActorDeclaration` identity rules remain separate.

Current Player evidence:

```text
Historical Full Player          25/25 preserved
Player current aggregate        27/27 PASS
Manager functional Player QA    14/14 PASS
Pause/Input/Gate                 8/8 PASS
Route Spatial Entry             18/18 PASS
Activity Relocation             23/23 PASS
Scene-Provided occurrence ID    FIRSTGAME Play Mode PASS
```

Current Player sample evidence from FIRSTGAME FG-ADR-002 Revision 4 plus the 2026-08-31 Scene-Provided reconciliation run:

```text
Getting Started / Scene Player  PROVEN
  LogicalActorsPrepared         READY / PASS
  GameplayReady                 READY / PASS
Player Provisioning             PLAY MODE PROVEN
Character Selection             PLAY MODE PROVEN
Local Multiplayer               PLANNED / BLOCKED
```

`GameplayReady` proves the current contextual gameplay projection over retained prepared Session Players. It does not by itself certify game-owned locomotion, camera composition, concrete gameplay input consumers or Presentation completeness.

Local Multiplayer remains blocked by public Slot/device/InputUser/control-scheme ownership/observation semantics. Arbitrary Actor Selection is delivered and is not a blocker.

## Current Activity content / visibility closure — IF-ADR-009 — 2026-08-30

Current architecture:

```text
ActivityContentContribution
  -> Activity ownership
  -> Local Content Id
  -> Required / Optional
  -> Activity content lifecycle

ActivityVisibilityRule
  -> presentation only
  -> no ownership
  -> no Requiredness
  -> no Activity content lifecycle authority
```

Current post-split QA:

```text
Contribution Authority     3/3  PASS
Visibility Isolation       2/2  PASS
Lifecycle regression      16/16 PASS
------------------------------------
Current post-split evidence 21/21 PASS
```

The lifecycle regression explicitly proves that Visibility membership does not broaden
Contribution ownership. Presentation may change with zero Contribution callbacks, and
Contribution lifecycle may exit while presentation remains visible for another listed
Activity.

The historical ADR-009 `46`-case certification remains dated evidence for the earlier
combined boundary only.

## Current Player scoped closure — IF-ADR-023 / IF-ADR-023A — 2026-08-31

Current architecture:

```text
Local Player Host composition
  -> reusable PlayerActorRuntimeHost

ActorProfile
  -> Actor-specific PresentationPrefab

PlayerActorDeclaration
  -> authored occurrence ID empty
  -> runtime occurrence identity established by physical preparation
```

Removed current authority:

```text
ActorProfile.LogicalActorHostPrefab
LogicalActorHost
SceneLogicalPlayerActorEvidence
HasLogicalActor
persistent authored PlayerActorDeclaration occurrence IDs
```

`LogicalActorsPrepared` remains semantic readiness terminology.

Current occurrence-identity invariant:

```text
before physical preparation boundary
  typed Player Actor occurrence ActorId unavailable

after identity establishment boundary
  typed Player Actor occurrence ActorId valid

after preparation commit
  retained physical evidence is authoritative
```

Current Scene-Provided Play Mode proof:

```text
LogicalActorsPrepared
  Activity readiness = Ready
  projected = 1
  selected = 1
  prepared = 1
  failed = 0

GameplayReady
  Activity readiness = Ready
  projected = 1
  selected = 1
  prepared = 1
  failed = 0
```

Current scoped-access reconciliation:

```text
Route scope     = Route lifecycle ownership
Activity scope  = Activity lifecycle ownership
scene location  != scope authority
```

Current teardown rule:

```text
consumer may die before persistent runtime owner
→ consumer-side binding releases on OnDestroy
→ later owner release tolerates destroyed Unity wrapper
→ diagnostics do not dereference destroyed object
```

## Current Stage B / FIRSTGAME priorities

1. **Player** — Scene Player physical/contextual lifecycle is proven through `GameplayReady`; Player Provisioning and Character Selection are proven. Remaining Getting Started work is game-owned Presentation/gameplay completeness, not Framework Player readiness. Local Multiplayer remains blocked by the public Slot/device/input contract.
2. **Loading / Readiness** — positive Game Flow consumer lane proven; negative/terminal robustness remains QA-owned.
3. **Camera** — Default-output integration proven; broader ADR-022 consumer coverage remains feature-owned.
4. **Pause** — runtime certified; remaining work is consumer authoring/usability only.
5. **Audio** — BGM technical + consumer integration proven; API maturity promotion is separate.
6. **Progression Save** — real consumer persistence/usability proof remains.
7. **Editor/Product Surface** — continue feature-owned Inspector/workflow evidence under ADR-010.

## Future / deferred contracts

- exact-Slot public Join;
- public Slot/device/InputUser/control-scheme ownership observation;
- device disconnect/reconnect and reassignment semantics;
- heterogeneous per-Slot Host Provisioning;
- consumer-facing prepared physical Actor hot-swap;
- generic respawn/checkpoint/dynamic Spawn beyond ADR-021;
- additional Camera families / split-screen / multiple outputs;
- application-scoped stable-ID resolver;
- Session-scoped frame-rate override;
- persisted frame-rate preference integration;
- advanced BGM simultaneous-source/crossfade semantics unless separately accepted.

`PLAYER-COMMAND-SURFACE-READINESS / DEFERRED` remains a product-availability concern: valid authored commands may be runtime-unbound and must reject without fallback until live scoped access exists.

## Documentation maintenance

- accepted ADRs remain normative;
- reconciliation records hold dated technical evidence;
- this tracker holds current mutable state, not full execution history;
- FIRSTGAME evidence is consumer/product evidence;
- historical certification counts are preserved rather than rewritten to imply later coverage.
